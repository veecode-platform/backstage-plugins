'@backstage/plugin-catalog-unprocessed-entities': patch
---

The Catalog Unprocessed Entities plugin can now be integrated as a tab within the DevTools plugin

- Added an export for `UnprocessedEntitiesContent`
- Updated the `README` with images of the features
- Adjusted the styles to fill in the available space
- Set the table page size to 20 as 40 was causing errors in the browser console

'@backstage/plugin-catalog-unprocessed-entities': patch
---

Export some types and API items. This allows people to call the API from different places with the ApiRef, as well
as completely customize the client if required. Check the [README.md](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/plugins/catalog-unprocessed-entities/README.md) to
note what needs to be added in order to use the new `catalogUnprocessedEntitiesApiRef` exported function.
